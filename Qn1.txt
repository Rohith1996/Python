The recent accident that injured a worker badly must be investigated under high level as not only cause it made severe damage now but kind of these accidents have happened in the past and they were not taken seriously .Management doesn't even consider the goodwill of their employee they don't file the reports of accidents if occur . If they have taken those seriously these accidents might have been reduced from occurring . There were also several near miss that has happened in past that employee shared with me stating that it might have affected severely if it had happened .There should be a thorough investigation to be carried out so that we can analyse the actual events that cause accidents like these . It can even take a mans life if not taken seriously at least now . The oil spillage which was on the floor has caused the FLT to skid on to the side and fell on the passer by employee . These are the things that has to be taken care by line manager who is in duty . There duty was to check these things and make sure everything is good to go . I sense lot of factors that determine the cause of these accidents . Hence there should be a full on high priority investigation to be carried out to get to know the truth behind these accidents happening . These will lead us to a better understanding about the faults in our system and to provide a way to rectify it and to be confident to work in a place that is safer .
