Positive health and safety management can clearly benefit organisation financially . Think of situation where an employee is injured , it has a huge impact on
the company both physically and financially .Even in our store many accidents and near miss have happened which has not been taken seriously in past months . This attitude has lead us to outcome of one FLT operating employee being seriously injured and subjected to bed rest for 6 weeeks for leg injury . Company has to be responsible for all the costs until employee gets recovered . These costs may be measured directly from the accident like injury cover,sick pay, repairs to damaged equipment which can be claimed through insurance but there are lot more other factors that indirectly affects company financially .It is often misinterpreted that most costs are recovered via insurance but fact is that they are not .Uninsured costs for things like Lost production,fines,Legal costs in defending civil claims in which not only company gets loss of money but also Bad publicity leading to loss of contracts and image of company .In a study by the UK Health and Safety Executive, it was shown that uninsured/hidden costs can be eight to 36 times the known insured costs .Hence comming to our situation the major cause of accidents is due to collison between FLT's and workers . The possible recommendation would be to segregate individual paths for FLT's and employee to function so that they wont have contact between and hence can reduce the accidents by the way .
